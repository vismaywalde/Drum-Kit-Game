# Drum Kit Game

Welcome to the Drum Kit Game! This project allows you to play different drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing specific keys on your keyboard. It's a fun and interactive way to learn and enjoy music!

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page (not provided, but expected to be part of the project).
3. `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for playing drum sounds and adding animations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Drum Kit Game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The HTML file sets up a basic structure with buttons for each drum sound. Each button has a class of `drum` and a specific letter representing the drum sound it plays.

```html

JavaScript Logic (index.js)
The JavaScript file handles the logic for playing the correct drum sound when a button is clicked or a key is pressed. It also adds a temporary animation to the button to give visual feedback.

How It Works
When a button is clicked or a corresponding key is pressed, the makeSound function is called to play the appropriate sound.
The buttonAnimation function adds a pressed class to the button for a brief moment to create a visual effect.
The sounds are stored in the sounds directory (not provided, but expected to be part of the project).
